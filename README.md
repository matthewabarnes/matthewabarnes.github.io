<p>Our&nbsp;research is&nbsp;rooted in community ecology, predicting and explaining 
species distributions and dispersal in aquatic systems. We are&nbsp;particularly 
interested in forecasting biological invasions– the movement of species beyond 
their historic native ranges– and conducting research that advances 
methodologies for the study and management of invasive species and the 
communities they impact. We&nbsp;utilize a broad set of tools to address many 
different types of ecological questions, so our&nbsp;research approaches&nbsp;include 
predicting species occurrence with species distribution models and geographic 
information systems (GIS), detecting rare species through environmental DNA 
(eDNA) surveillance, and investigating species impacts through field 
observations and laboratory experiments. </p>
